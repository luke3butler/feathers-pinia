# Install Modules

[[toc]]

Pinia's well-designed architecture allows it to be modular while also functioning as a central store. This means that we don't have to register each service's store in a central location. Here's are the recommended steps for setting up Feathers-Pinia:

## Pinia and Feathers-Pinia

Install these packages using your preferred package manager.  Until version 1.0.0, it's recommended that you add a `~` in front of the version number for Feathers-Pinia to only get patch releases.

```bash
npm i pinia feathers-pinia
```

## Feathers

If your app will use socket.io, install these packages:

```bash
npm i @feathersjs/feathers@pre @feathersjs/authentication-client@pre @feathersjs/socketio-client@pre socket.io-client
```

If your app will use feathers-rest (no realtime connection), install these packages:

```bash
npm i @feathersjs/feathers@pre @feathersjs/authentication-client@pre @feathersjs/rest-client@pre
```

## TypeScript

By default, TypeScript will expect you to strictly identify properties on Model classes.  See the `!` in the following example:

```ts
class User extends BaseModel {
  foo!: string
  bar!: number
}
```

You can optionally configure `tsconfig.json` to not require the `!` on every property. Add the `strictPropertyInitialization` property to the `compilerOptions`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictPropertyInitialization": false,
  },
}
```

With `strictPropertyInitialization` turned off, you can declare class properties as normal:

```ts
class User extends BaseModel {
  foo: string // No `!` needed after every property
  bar: number
}
```
