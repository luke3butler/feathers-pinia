# Model Instances

[[toc]]

Using model instances enables some of the most-useful code patterns in Feathers-Pinia. Instances provide easy access to common methods **directly at the data level**. Essentially, each record has a common interface that allows you to write more succinct and useful code.

## Creating Instances

Model instances come from Model classes, so to create an instance we need to obtain a class, first. One way to retrieve a class that works very well with Pinia is to pull it from the store, itself. This allows the store to show in the Pinia devtools. (A store won't show in the devtools until you `use` it inside of a component instance.)

```ts
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'

// Now the todos store will show up in the pinia devtools.
const todoStore = useTodos()

// The model class is found at store.Model.
const Todo = todoStore.Model

const todo = new Todo({ description: 'Do the Dishes' })
```

One new feature of Feathers-Pinia is that it doesn't try to add every single instance to the store. You can have instances outside of the store. In the above example, `todo` is not yet in the store. We can still show it on screen and even bind to it in a form. Let's add it to the store.

```ts
todo.addToStore()
```

Wasn't that nice! The `addToStore` method is just hanging out there on the data, waiting to be used. In most cases, it's far more convenient than a verbose API like this:

```ts
// This doesn't actually exist. This API couples this component to the `feathers-pinia` module.
import { addToStore } from 'feathers-pinia'

addToStore(todo)
```

Every import in a component adds a tight coupling. You can't copy that component to another project without also installing the `feathers-pinia` dependency. But when you use an abstraction layer like putting methods directly on each instance, you only have a dependency on the method. The underlying implementation can change or be mocked very easily for tests.

Using instance methods for data is a supportive pattern in almost every scenario, especially when it comes to making API requests and managing store data. One huge benefit is that the common instance interface allows for making generic components that handle multiple types of data. The component doesn't have to know that it's dealing with a Todo or a User. It just knows that the records have a `.save()` method.

So let's dive into the common interface. Here's the instance API.

## Instance Methods

### `instance.addToStore()`

You can call an instance's `addToStore()` method to make it reactive. Before adding an instance to the store, it's not reactive:

```ts
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

// Plain, Non-Reactive JS Object
const todo = new todoStore.Model({ description: 'Do the Dishes' })

// Reactive Vue Object
const todo = new todoStore.Model({ description: 'Do the Dishes' }).addToStore()
```

<BlockQuote label="Tip About Reactivity">

Model instances are NOT reactive until you call `instance.addToStore()`. However, a non-reactive model instance will update with the server data after `create`.  If you want reactive data for `patch` or `update` methods, you need to call `instance.addToStore()`, first.  If you want to bind to a template, you call `addToStore`, first.

</BlockQuote>

### `instance.removeFromStore()`

You can manually remove an instance from the store by calling `.removeFromStore()` on a Model instance.  This method does not remove the data from the server.

```ts
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

// Instance is in the store
const todo = new todoStore.Model({ description: 'Do the Dishes' }).addToStore()

// Instance is no longer in the store.
todo.removeFromStore()
```

### `instance.save(params)`

The `save` method is a convenience wrapper for the `create/patch` methods. If the records has no `id` field matching the `idField`, the `instance.create()`method will be used. The`params` argument will be used in the Feathers client request. See the [Feathers Service](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/services.html#service-methods) docs, for reference on where params are used in each method.

```ts
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

// Call addToStore to get a reactive Vue object
const todo = new todoStore.Model({ description: 'Do something!' }).addToStore()

await todo.save() // --> Creates the todo on the server.
```

Once the `create` response returns, the record will have an idField that's usually assigned by the server.  Most databases are setup to give each record an `id`.  Others use a different field. For example, MongoDB uses `_id`. If you call `instance.save()` again, the method will call `instance.patch()`. Which method is used depends solely on whether the data has a proeprty matchin ghte `idField` in the service store.

<BlockQuote label="No `preferUpdate` option" type="info">

Feathers-Pinia does not currently have a `preferUpdate` option, which was available in Feathers-Vuex. You can either call `.update()` instead of `save()`. Feel free to open a PR or issue if you need the feature.

</BlockQuote>

### `instance.create(params)`

The `create` method calls the `create` action (service method) using the instance data. The `params` argument will be used in the Feathers client request. See the [Feathers Service](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/services.html#service-methods) docs, for reference.

You might not ever need to use `.create()`, but can instead use the `.save()` method. Let Feathers-Pinia call `create` or `patch`.

```js
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

const todo = new Todo({ description: 'Do something!' })

todo.create() // --> Creates the todo on the server using the instance data
```

### `instance.patch(params)`

The `patch` method calls the `patch` action (service method) using the instance data. The instance's id field is used for the `patch` id. The `params` argument will be used in the Feathers client request. See the [Feathers Service](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/services.html#service-methods) docs, for reference.

Similar to the `.create()` method, you might not ever need to use `.patch()` if you just use `.save()` and let Feathers-Pinia figure out how to handle it.

```js
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

const todo = new TodotodoStore.Model({ id: 1, description: 'Do something!' })
todo.description = 'Do something else'
await todo.patch() // --> Sends a `patch` request the with the id and description.
```

You can provide an object as `params.data`, and Feathers-Pinia will use it as the patch data. This allows patching with partial data:

```js
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

const todo = new todoStore.Model({ description: 'Do Something', isComplete: false })
await todo.patch({ data: { isComplete: true } })
```

```ts

save_user({ diff: 'name' })

// Only available for clones
todoClone.patch({ diff: Key, Key[], obj })
todoClone.patch({ data: diffedObj })

todoClone.patch({ diff: 'name' })
todoClone.patch({ data: { name: 'foo' } })

todoClone.patch({ diff: ['name', 'photo'] })
todoClone.patch({ data: { name: 'foo', photo: 'bar' } })

todoClone.patch({ diff: { name: 'foo', photo: 'bar' } })
todoClone.patch({ data: { name: 'foo' } }) // only name changed, so photo doesn't get sent.

todoClone.patch({ diff: 'name', with: ['teamId'] })
todoClone.patch({ data: { name: 'foo', requiredKey: 'bar' } })
```

Additional Features:

- MongoDB can patch nested data with dot-notated keys.
- How can we support MongoDB multi sub-document patching?

### `instance.update(params)`

The `update` method calls the `update` action (service method) using the instance data. The instance's id field is used for the `update` id. The `params` argument will be used in the Feathers client request. See the [Feathers Service](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/services.html#service-methods) docs, for reference.

Use `.update()` whenever you want to completely replace the data on the server with the instance data.

```js
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

const todo = new todoStore.Model({ id: 1, description: 'Do something!' })
todo.description = 'Do something else'
await todo.update() // --> Sends a `update` request the with all instance data.
```

### `instance.remove(params)`

The `remove` method calls the `remove` action (service method) using the instance data. The instance's id field is used for the `remove` id. The `params` argument will be used in the Feathers client request. See the [Feathers Service](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/services.html#service-methods) docs, for reference.

```js
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

const todo = new todoStore.Model({ id: 1, description: 'Do something!' })
todo.save().then((todo) => {
  todo.remove() // --> Deletes the record from the server
})
```

### `instance.clone(params)`

The `.clone()` method creates a deep copy of the record and stores it on `store.copiesById`. This allows you to make changes to the clone and not update visible data until you commit or save the data.

```ts
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

const todo = new todoStore.Model({ id: 1, description: 'Do something!' })
const todoCopy = todo.clone()
todoCopy.description = 'Do something else!'
todoCopy.commit() // --> Update the data in the store.
console.log(todo.description) // --> 'Do something else!'
console.log(todoCopy.description) // --> 'Do something else!'
```

Calling `clone()` at any time will copy the data from the original to the clone, essentially performing a reset.

At some point in the future, Pinia will have support for Vuex's `strict` mode. It throws errors if any changes occur in the Vuex store `state` outside of mutations. Since strict mode doesn't exist in Pinia, yet, all clones are kept in `store.clonesById`. Changing a clone won't throw an error since there's no strict mode. Once Pinia supports strict mode, Feathers-Pinia will be updated to keep copies outside of the store by default.

### `instance.commit(params)`

Calling `instance.commit()` will copy any changes from the clone to the original record.

```ts
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

const todo = new todoStore.Model({ id: 1, description: 'Do something!' })
const todoCopy = todo.clone()
todoCopy.description = 'Do something else!'
todoCopy.commit() // --> Update the data in the store.
console.log(todo.description) // --> 'Do something else!'
console.log(todoCopy.description) // --> 'Do something else!'
```

## Reset an Instance

To reset an instance, call `.reset()`.

```js
import { useTodos } from '../store/todos'
const todoStore = useTodos()

const todo = new todoStore.Model({ id: 1, description: 'Do something!' })
const todoCopy = todo.clone()
todoCopy.description = 'Do something else!'
todoCopy.reset() // --> Resets the record to match the one in the store.
console.log(todo.description) // --> 'Do something!'
console.log(todoCopy.description) // --> 'Do something!'
```
