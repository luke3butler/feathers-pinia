# Introduction

Feathers-Pinia is the next generation of [Feathers-Vuex](https://vuex.feathersjs.com). The difference is that it's built on [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/): a Vue store with an intuitive API.

Using Pinia in your apps will have a few positive effects:

- The clean API requires lower mental overhead to use.
  - No more weird Vuex syntax.
  - No more mutations; just actions.
  - Use Composable Stores instead of injected rootState, rootGetters, etc.
- Lower mental overhead means developers spend more time in a creative space. This usually results in an increase of productivity.
- You'll have smaller bundle sizes. Not only is Pinia tiny, it's also modular. You don't have to register all of the plugins in a central store. Pinia's architecture enables tree shaking, so only the services needed for the current view need to load.
