# What's New in 1.0

Feathers-Pinia 1.0 is a huge update with some great new features.  This page will go over some of the highlights.

[[toc]]

## Huge Performance Boost 🎉

Feathers-Pinia is SO MUCH faster than its predecessor.  You'll see massive benefits from the faster reactive types under the hood of Pinia and Vue 3. But we've gone a step further and fine-tuned and tested Feathers-Pinia to never perform extra work.  Some of the biggest improvements are:

- No unnecessary stack frames happen under the hood. We've even written tests to assure that Model constructors only run a single time. We stand firmly against wasted CPU cycles!
- As from the beginning, you still have full control over adding instances to the store with `new User().addToStore()`.
- For the features that require objects to be in the store (for example, `handleClones`) feathers-pinia will implicitly add items to the store when needed.

## Support SQL `$like` Operators 🎁

The most-requested feature has finally landed: built-in support for SQL `LIKE`. This means the queries made to the store will **finally** automatically match the queries made to your SQL-backed API.

These are the supported operators:

- `$like` and `$notLike` for case-sensitive matches
- `$ilike`, `$iLike`, and `$notILike` for case-insensitive matches

Let's have a look at them in action. First, assume that we have the following messages in the store:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "text": "Moose" },
  { "id": 2, "text": "moose" },
  { "id": 3, "text": "Goose" },
  { "id": 4, "text": "Loose" },
]
```

Now see the fancy new query operators in action:

```ts
import { useMessages } from '../stores/messages'
const messageStore = useMessages

// $like
const { data: $like } = messageStore.findInStore({
  query: { text: { $like: '%Mo%' } }
})
expect($like.map((m) => m.id)).toEqual([1])

// $notLike
const { data: $notLike } = messageStore.findInStore({
  query: { text: { $notLike: '%Mo%' } }
})
expect($notLike.map((m) => m.id)).toEqual([2, 3, 4])

// $ilike
const { data: $ilike } = messageStore.findInStore({
  query: { text: { $ilike: '%Mo%' } }
})
expect($ilike.map((m) => m.id)).toEqual([1, 2])

// $iLike
const { data: $iLike } = messageStore.findInStore({
  query: { text: { $iLike: '%Mo%' } }
})
expect($iLike.map((m) => m.id)).toEqual([1, 2])

// $notILike
const { data: $notILike } = messageStore.findInStore({
  query: { text: { $notILike: '%Mo%' } }
})
expect($notILike.map((m) => m.id)).toEqual([3, 4])
```

These new operators support queries made with SQL-backed adapters like the official, core SQL service adapter in Feathers v5 Dove:

- [@feathersjs/knex](https://dove.feathersjs.com/api/databases/knex.html)

These adapters for are also supported:

- [feathers-knex](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-knex), the Feathers v4 Crow version of `@feathersjs/knex`, above
- [feathers-objection](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-objection)
- [feathers-sequelize](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-sequelize)

If you use any of the above database adapters, give the new query operators a try!  Enjoy your new superpowers!

## New `useAuth` for Setup Stores 🎁

Create ultra-flexible `setup stores` with the new [useAuth](/guide/use-auth) utility:

```ts
// src/store/store.auth.ts
import { defineStore, acceptHMRUpdate } from 'pinia'
import { useAuth } from 'feathers-pinia'

export const useAuthStore = defineStore('auth', () => {
  const { userStore } = useUserStore()
  const { $api } = useFeathers()

  const auth = useAuth({
    api: $api,
    userStore,
  })

  auth.reAuthenticate()

  return auth
})

if (import.meta.hot) {
  import.meta.hot.accept(acceptHMRUpdate(useAuthStore, import.meta.hot))
}
```

## Class Definition Defaults 🎁

[Small breaking change]

Defaults values can now be specified directly on the Model interface. Custom constructors have been made much cleaner due to the new `instance.init()` BaseModel method.  After calling `super(data, options)` to initialize the BaseModel, the `init` method can be called from `this`:

```ts
// Minimum required constructor
constructor(data: Partial<Message> = {}, options: Record<string, any> = {}) {
  super(data, options)
  this.init(data)
}
```

Here are the technical details of how the new Model behavior works.  For the TLDR version, just make your Model classes look like next example.

- BaseModel no longer calls `setupInstance`, internally.  If you use a custom constructor together with `instanceDefaults` and `setupInstance`, the two methods are run twice, wasting cycles.
- BaseModel still calls `instanceDefaults` internally, which means it runs twice.  If you are using `instanceDefaults` only for default values, as documented, then the performance impact will be negligible, even when ingesting large amounts of data from the API server.  No complex logic should run in `instanceDefaults`.  It has two purposes. Any use outside of these two purposes should be refactored into `setupInstance`:
  - Allow specifying default values with low boilerplate.
  - Allow conditional defaults values to be assigned based on incoming data.
- Calling `new User(data)` without a custom constructor results in Model interface defaults always overwriting `data`.
- Having a custom constructor allows Model instance default values to initialize as one would expect: not overwriting any other values.
- Calling `this.init(data)` runs the `instanceDefaults` again and also runs `setupInstance`.

```ts
// Define the interface and defaults directly on the Model instead of `instanceDefaults`.
export class Message extends BaseModel {
  _id: number
  text = ''
  userId: null | number = null
  createdAt: Date | null = null

  // This is the minimum required constructor
  constructor(data: Partial<Message> = {}, options: Record<string, any> = {}) {
    super(data, options)
    this.init(data)
  }

  static setupInstance(message: Partial<Message>) {
    // access `store` and `models` from this
    const { store, models } = this
  }
}
```

## Built-in Patch Diffing 🎁

<BlockQuote label="PRODUCTIVITY TIP">

Don't waste bandwidth! Just send the props that change!

</BlockQuote>

Patch diffing from Feathers-Vuex is now back in Feathers-Pinia with a smarter, faster algorithm that will work for any scenario you can dream up.

Diffing only occurs on `patch` requests and `save` requests that call a `patch`.

```ts
// clone a record
const clone = user.clone()
// make changes
clone.name = 'Feathers is Amazing!'
// save
await clone.save(). // --> Only the changed props go to the server!
```

<BlockQuote label="How It Works" type="info">

- By default, all keys are deep-compared between the original record and the clone.
- Once all changes are found, only the top-level keys are sent to the server.

Diffing will work on all databases without data loss. It will be extensible in the future to support databases that allow patching of deeply-nested values in sub-documents or embedded JSON.

</BlockQuote>

### Customize the Diff

You can use the `diff` option to customize which values are compared.  Only props that have changed will be sent to the server.

```ts
// string: diff only this prop
await clone.save({ diff: 'teamId' )

// array: diff only these props
await clone.save({ diff: ['teamId', 'username'] )

// object: merge and diff these props
await clone.save({ diff: {teamId: 1, username: 'foo' } )

// or turn off diffing and send everything
await clone.save({ diff: false })
```

### Always Save Certain Props

If there are certain props that need to always go with the request, use the `with` option:

```ts
// string: always include this prop
await clone.save({ with: 'teamId' )

// array: always include these props
await clone.save({ with: ['teamId', 'username'] )

// object: merge and include these props
await clone.save({ with: {teamId: 1, username: 'foo' } )
```

## Handle Associations

Two new utilities make it easier to add relationships between records without depending on associations in-memory.  You can setup associations in both directions between models.

### `associateFind` 🎁

The `associateFind` utility allows you to define one-to-many relationships on your Model classes.

```ts
import { BaseModel, associateFind } from 'feathers-pinia'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  _id: string
  email = ''
  userId: null | number = null
  createdAt: Date | null = null

  // Values added in `setupInstance` can be added to the interface for type friendliness.
  messages?: Array<Partial<User>>

  constructor(data?: Partial<Message>, options: Record<string, any> = {}) {
    super(data, options)
    this.init(data)
  }

  static setupInstance(user: Partial<Message>) {
    // access to `store` and `models` is from `this`.
    const { store, models } = this

    associateFind(user, 'messages', {
      Model: models.api.Message,
      makeParams: (user) => {
        return { query: { id: user._id } }
      },
    })
  }
}
```

### `associateGet` 🎁

## New `useFind` API 🎁

The `useFind` API has been completely rewritten from scratch. A couple of its best features include

- **Intelligent Fall-Through Caching** - Like SWR, but way smarter.
- **Pagination Support** - Built in, sharing the same logic with `usePagination`.

See all of the features on the [`useFind` page](./use-find).

### Client Paging, Manual Fetch

Let's look at the two most-common use cases. This example shows client-side pagination with manual fetch:

```ts
import usePosts from '../stores/posts'

const postStore = usePosts()

const { data, next, prev, find } = postStore.useFind({ query: {} })

// fetch data
await find()

// move to the next page
await next()

// move to the previous page
await prev()
```

See the component example of client-side pagination on the [`useFind` page](./use-find).

### Server Paging, Auto Fetch

Another common use case is server-side pagination. Enable it by passing `onServer` in the params. You can also pull out `isPending` to show a status indicator when a request is pending. That's it!

```ts
import usePosts from '../stores/posts'

const postStore = usePosts()

const { data, next, prev, isPending } = postStore.useFind({ 
  query: {}, 
  onServer: true 
})

// move to the next page
await next()

// move to the previous page
await prev()
```

See the component example of server-side pagination on the [`useFind` page](./use-find).

## `useFindWatched` API ⚠️

To make migration to the new `useFind` API easier, the old `useFind` API has been renamed and is now called [`useFindWatched`](./use-find-watched.md).

Learn more about the old API on the [`useFindWatched` page](./use-find-watched.md).

See the new API on the [`useFind` page](./use-find.md).

## Store API Improvements

The `useFind` utility -- for implementing fall-through-cached `find` requests -- is now available directly on the store, further reducing boilerplate.

### `store.useFind` ➕

With the old way, you have to import `useFind` and provide the model to it from the instantiated store.

```ts
import { useFind } from 'feathers-pinia'
import { useTutorials } from '../store/tutorials'

const tutorialStore = useTutorials()
const tutorialsParams = computed(() => {
  return { query: {}, }
})
const { items: tutorials } = useFind({ model: tutorialStore.Model, params: tutorialsParams })
```

In the new way, there's no need to import useFind. Call it as a method on the store and don't pass `model`

```ts
import { useTutorials } from '../store/tutorials'

const tutorialStore = useTutorials()
const tutorialsParams = computed(() => {
  return { query: {}, }
})
const { items: tutorials } = tutorialStore.useFind({ params: tutorialsParams })
```

Just think of all of the extra time you'll have instead of having to write those 1.5 lines of code over and over again! 😁

### `store.useGet` ➕

The `useGet` utility -- for implementing fall-through-cached `get` requests -- is now available directly on the store, further reducing boilerplate.

## Smaller Package Size 🎉

When it comes to npm bundles, smaller package size is a good thing.

### Optimized Vite Build 💪

The overall bundle size has been reduced from around 20kb to 12kb, gzipped.  This was done through

- Replacing hefty dependencies, like lodash's debounce, with smaller equivalents, like [just-debounce](https://npmjs.com/package/just-debounce).
- Optimizing the Vite build to externalize modules.

Here is the previous output from `npx vite-bundle-visualizer` to compare.  All of the modules highlighted, below, were able to be removed from the package, resulting in a much leaner build:

### LZW Storage is Out ➖

Prior to this version, Feathers-Pinia included a localStorage plugin that used LZW compression. It came with the benefit of doubling the amount of data you could put in storage. The downside was that it made the bundle size big, so we removed it.  It will be published as an independent package at a later date.

Our LocalStorage adapter remains part of the package and is so fast that it makes Single Page Apps feel like they're doing Server Side Rendering.  If you haven't tried it, yet, it's easy to setup and it's worth it!

## Lots of Little Improvments
